This plan outlines the steps to build the single-player MVP, with validation tests for each milestone:

Step 1: Set Up ThreeJS Scene and Terrain
Create a ThreeJS scene with a renderer, camera, and basic lighting.
Add a simple terrain (e.g., a plane with elevation or basic shapes for mountains).
Test: Load the game in a browser; ensure the terrain renders correctly.

Step 2: Add Wing-Suit Model
Use a simple 3D model (e.g., a capsule or box) for the wing-suit.
Place it at the racecourseâ€™s starting position.
Test: Reload the game; verify the wing-suit appears at the start.

Step 3: Implement Camera Follow
Set the camera to track the wing-suit (e.g., third-person view behind it).
Test: Move the wing-suit manually in code; confirm the camera follows.

Step 4: Add Steering Controls
Bind left/right arrow keys to rotate the wing-suit.
Test: Press steering keys; check if the wing-suit turns accordingly.

Step 5: Add Speed Controls
Bind up/down arrow keys to adjust speed (dive to accelerate, pull up to decelerate).
Test: Use speed controls; observe changes in wing-suit movement.

Step 6: Implement Flight Physics
Apply gravity to pull the wing-suit downward.
Add air resistance to slow horizontal movement.
Update position each frame based on velocity and forces.
Test: Let the wing-suit fall without input; ensure it drops and slows naturally.

Step 7: Place Obstacles
Add 3D obstacles (e.g., cubes) along the course.
Implement basic collision detection.
Test: Fly into an obstacle; confirm collision stops or resets the wing-suit.

Step 8: Define Start and Finish Lines
Place visual markers (e.g., gates) for the start and finish.
Detect when the wing-suit crosses them.
Test: Pass through both lines; verify detection triggers correctly.

Step 9: Add Race Timer
Start the timer at the start line and stop it at the finish line.
Test: Fly through the course; ensure the timer runs and stops as expected.

Step 10: Display Speed and Time
Add a HUD showing current speed and elapsed time.
Test: Fly the wing-suit; confirm the HUD updates in real-time.

Step 11: Show Final Time
Display the completion time on-screen after finishing.
Include a restart option (e.g., button or key).
Test: Finish the race; check that the final time and restart option appear.

Step 12: Save Best Time
Store the best time in localStorage and display it post-race.
Test: Complete multiple races; verify the best time updates and persists.

Step 13: Add Restart Functionality
Reset the wing-suit position and timer when restarting.
Test: Restart after finishing; ensure the game resets properly.

Step 14: Optimize Performance
Profile the game and fix any frame rate drops (target: 30 FPS).
Test: Run on a mid-range device; confirm smooth performance.

Step 15: Full Game Test
Play the entire race multiple times to catch bugs or polish issues.
Test: Complete the course; verify all features work seamlessly.
