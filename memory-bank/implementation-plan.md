Implementation Plan for Wing-Suit Flying Racing Game MVP
This document provides a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a wing-suit flying racing game. The plan focuses on the base game, including essential features such as flying mechanics, a single racecourse, basic obstacles, and real-time multiplayer functionality. Each step is small, specific, and includes a test to validate correct implementation. The tech stack includes ThreeJS for 3D rendering, Node.js with Socket.IO for multiplayer networking, and deployment on Netlify and Heroku, adhering to Cursor rules emphasizing modularity, performance, scalability, networking best practices, security, and thorough testing.

Note: Throughout the implementation, organize the code into separate modules or files, each handling a specific aspect of the game (e.g., rendering, controls, networking, game logic). This ensures maintainability and scalability.

## Technical Specifications
- **3D Models**: Use pre-existing models from free or paid libraries. Customize in Blender if needed. Aim for low to medium level of detail (LOD) to prioritize functionality over graphics.
- **Physics**: Implement simplified physics with basic gravity, speed adjusted by controls, and simple air resistance. Tune parameters for a 1-2 minute course that's easy to control.
- **Multiplayer**: Support minimum 2 players. Use rooms with unique codes. Implement position interpolation and client-side prediction for handling latency.
- **Security**: Use server-authoritative model to validate positions and velocities to prevent cheating.
- **Performance**: Target minimum 30 FPS on mid-range devices (e.g., iPhone 8 or similar Android).
- **UI/UX**: Simple HUD showing speed and time. Basic menu for creating/joining rooms.
- **Testing**: Use Jest for backend testing, Mocha or Jasmine for frontend. Aim for 70-80% test coverage in critical areas (movement, multiplayer).

## Implementation Steps

Step 0: Set Up Development Environment
- Install Node.js and necessary dependencies on your system.
- Create a new project directory for the game.
- Initialize a new Node.js project for the backend using a package manager (e.g., npm or yarn).
- Set up a basic frontend structure with an HTML file, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for logic.
- Install the ThreeJS library and the Socket.IO client library as dependencies in the frontend.
- Test:
  - Create a simple "Hello World" server that listens on a port and a client that connects to it. Run both locally and confirm that the client displays a message from the server in the browser console.

Step 1: Set Up ThreeJS Scene with Basic Terrain
- Initialize a ThreeJS scene with a camera, renderer, and basic lighting (e.g., ambient light).
- Import a pre-existing terrain model from a free/paid library to represent the racecourse. Ensure it has a low-medium LOD for performance.
- Optimize the terrain model for mid-range devices, aiming for at least 30 FPS.
- Test:
  - Render the scene in the browser and verify that the terrain is visible, properly lit, and distinguishable as a landscape.
  - Confirm FPS is at least 30 on a mid-range test device.

Step 2: Create Wing-Suit Model
- Import a pre-existing wing-suit model from a free/paid library. If necessary, customize it in Blender.
- Ensure the model has an appropriate level of detail (low-medium) for performance.
- Position the wing-suit model in the scene at a starting point above the terrain.
- Test:
  - Reload the game in the browser and confirm that the wing-suit model appears at the correct starting position and is visible against the terrain.
  - Verify that adding the model doesn't significantly impact performance.

Step 3: Implement Camera Follow
- Configure the camera to follow the wing-suit model as it moves through the scene.
- Adjust the camera to maintain a consistent distance and angle (e.g., slightly behind and above the wing-suit).
- Test:
  - Manually update the wing-suit's position in the code, reload the game, and check that the camera follows the wing-suit smoothly without jittering or losing sight of it.

Step 4: Add Basic Steering Controls
- Implement input handling to steer the wing-suit left and right using keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys).
- Update the wing-suit's rotation based on the input received.
- Ensure controls are responsive and intuitive.
- Test:
  - Launch the game, press the steering keys, and observe if the wing-suit rotates left or right in response to the inputs as expected.

Step 5: Add Speed Controls
- Add input handling for diving (e.g., down arrow to increase speed) and pulling up (e.g., up arrow to decrease speed).
- Adjust the wing-suit's velocity based on these inputs, ensuring speed increases when diving and decreases when pulling up.
- Tune controls to make the course completable in 1-2 minutes.
- Test:
  - Use the speed control inputs while running the game and verify that the wing-suit's speed changes appropriately (e.g., moves faster when diving, slower when pulling up).

Step 6: Implement Basic Flight Physics
- Apply gravity to the wing-suit, causing it to fall downward over time.
- Add air resistance to reduce the wing-suit's speed naturally when not diving.
- Update the wing-suit's position in each frame based on its velocity, gravity, and air resistance.
- Keep physics simple but believable - prioritize fun over realism.
- Test:
  - Start the game and let the wing-suit fall without input; confirm that it accelerates downward due to gravity and that air resistance slows its horizontal movement over time.

Step 7: Add Basic Obstacles and Collision Detection
- Import simple pre-existing 3D objects as obstacles along the racecourse.
- Keep obstacle models at low-medium LOD for performance.
- Implement collision detection to check when the wing-suit intersects with these obstacles.
- Handle collisions by either stopping the wing-suit or resetting it to a previous position.
- Test:
  - Fly the wing-suit into an obstacle and ensure the collision is detected (e.g., movement stops or the wing-suit resets) without passing through the object.
  - Verify obstacle rendering maintains target 30 FPS on mid-range devices.

Step 8: Set Up Node.js Server with Socket.IO
- Create a new Node.js project for the backend and install the Socket.IO library.
- Set up a server that listens for client connections on a specified port.
- Implement room creation with unique codes for game sessions.
- Add logic to handle client disconnections gracefully, removing them from the server's state.
- Test:
  - Start the server, open multiple browser tabs as clients, and connect them to the server using room codes.
  - Verify that connections are established and that disconnecting a tab doesn't crash the server.

Step 9: Implement Server-Authoritative Model
- Design a server-authoritative model where the server validates client inputs and physics.
- Set reasonable bounds for position and velocity changes to prevent cheating.
- Have the server correct client positions if they exceed valid parameters.
- Test:
  - Modify a test client to send invalid position data and verify the server corrects it.
  - Confirm regular gameplay isn't negatively affected by the validation.

Step 10: Sync Player Positions
- On the client side, send the wing-suit's current position to the server at regular intervals (e.g., every 50ms).
- On the server side, validate the positions and broadcast each player's position to all connected clients in the same room.
- On the client side, implement position interpolation to smooth movement of other players' wing-suits.
- Add client-side prediction to handle network latency.
- Test:
  - Connect two clients to the same room, move the wing-suit in one client, and confirm that the other client sees the wing-suit moving in real-time with minimal delay.
  - Test with artificial network delay to verify interpolation works correctly.

Step 11: Connect Frontend to Backend (Locally)
- Update the frontend JavaScript to establish a Socket.IO connection to the local Node.js server.
- Ensure the connection persists during gameplay.
- Implement connection status indicators in the UI.
- Test:
  - Run both the local server and the frontend, then check the browser console for a successful WebSocket connection message indicating the frontend is linked to the backend.

Step 12: Define Racecourse Start and End
- Place a starting line and a finish line in the scene (e.g., using visible markers like planes or lines).
- Add logic to detect when the wing-suit crosses the starting line to begin the race and the finish line to end it.
- Test:
  - Fly the wing-suit through the starting line and then the finish line; verify that the race state changes correctly (e.g., race begins and ends as expected).

Step 13: Implement Race Timer
- Start a timer when the wing-suit crosses the starting line.
- Stop the timer when the wing-suit crosses the finish line.
- Store the elapsed time for later display.
- Ensure timer accuracy is consistent across clients.
- Test:
  - Fly through a race from start to finish and confirm that the timer starts at the beginning, stops at the end, and records an accurate elapsed time.

Step 14: Add Speed and Time Display
- Create a simple Heads-Up Display (HUD) in the frontend to show the wing-suit's current speed and the race timer.
- Update these values in real-time as the player flies.
- Ensure the HUD is minimalistic and doesn't obstruct gameplay.
- Test:
  - Fly the wing-suit while observing the HUD; ensure that the speed increases/decreases with controls and the timer increments accurately during the race.

Step 15: Create Basic Menu System
- Implement a simple menu for creating or joining game rooms via unique codes.
- Add options to restart a race or return to the main menu after finishing.
- Keep the UI simple and functional.
- Test:
  - Navigate through all menu options and verify they function correctly.
  - Create a room, join it with another client, and verify both clients enter the same race.

Step 16: Handle Player Joins and Leaves
- Allow new players to join an ongoing race by adding their wing-suit to the scene and server state.
- Remove a player's wing-suit from the scene and server state when they disconnect.
- Add visual/audio feedback when players join or leave.
- Test:
  - Disconnect a player mid-race and confirm their wing-suit disappears from other players' views.
  - Add a new player and ensure their wing-suit appears.

Step 17: Implement Basic Input Validation
- On the server, validate incoming client data (e.g., position updates) to ensure it's within reasonable bounds (e.g., not impossibly fast or outside the racecourse).
- Reject or correct invalid data to prevent cheating.
- Test:
  - Modify a client to send extreme or invalid position data (e.g., teleporting across the map) and verify that the server either rejects it or adjusts it to a valid state.

Step 18: Optimize Network Traffic
- Limit the frequency of position updates sent from clients to the server (e.g., every 50 milliseconds instead of every frame).
- Use a compact data format for network messages (e.g., JSON with only essential fields like x, y, z coordinates).
- Test:
  - Use browser developer tools to monitor network traffic; confirm that updates are sent at the specified interval and the data payload is minimal yet sufficient.

Step 19: Implement Performance Optimization
- Add level-of-detail (LOD) management for distant objects.
- Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects.
- Set up performance monitoring tools to track FPS.
- Optimize render loop and physics calculations.
- Test:
  - Run performance tests on mid-range devices to ensure at least 30 FPS during normal gameplay.
  - Profile the application to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

Step 20: Test Full Game Flow
- Launch the game with multiple clients connected locally.
- Have players fly through the racecourse, avoiding obstacles, while checking rendering, controls, physics, and networking.
- Complete the race and verify that times are recorded and displayed accurately.
- Test:
  - Successfully finish a multiplayer race without crashes, significant lag, or inconsistencies between clients; note any issues for iteration.

Step 21: Implement Automated Testing
- Set up Jest for backend testing of server-side logic.
- Set up Mocha or Jasmine for frontend testing.
- Write tests for critical components (movement, collision, multiplayer synchronization).
- Aim for 70-80% test coverage in these critical areas.
- Test:
  - Run the test suite and verify all tests pass with the target coverage rate.

Step 22: Deploy Frontend to Netlify
- Build the frontend project into static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS).
- Upload the build to Netlify using their deployment interface or CLI.
- Configure Netlify to serve the game from a custom URL.
- Test:
  - Access the game via the Netlify URL in a browser and ensure the scene loads correctly with all local functionality intact.

Step 23: Deploy Backend to Heroku
- Prepare the Node.js server for deployment by adding a Procfile and specifying the start command.
- Deploy the server to Heroku using their CLI or Git integration.
- Set any necessary environment variables (e.g., port number).
- Test:
  - Connect to the Heroku server URL from a test client and confirm that it accepts connections and responds as expected.

Step 24: Update Frontend to Connect to Deployed Backend
- Modify the frontend code to connect to the Heroku-hosted Socket.IO server instead of the local server.
- Rebuild and redeploy the frontend to Netlify with the updated configuration.
- Test:
  - Load the game on the Netlify URL, connect multiple players, and verify that multiplayer functionality (e.g., position syncing, race results) works seamlessly with the Heroku backend.

Step 25: Create Documentation
- Write developer documentation with setup instructions and API reference.
- Include comments in code explaining complex logic.
- Create a README with deployment instructions.
- Document known issues and future improvement areas.
- Test:
  - Have a team member follow the documentation to set up the development environment and make a small change to verify clarity.
