Frontend: ThreeJS for 3D rendering, with optional Cannon.js for basic physics if needed.
Backend: Node.js with Socket.IO for real-time multiplayer communication.
Deployment: Static hosting (e.g., Netlify) for the frontend and a Node.js-compatible hosting service (e.g., Heroku) for the backend.
Why This Stack?
Frontend: ThreeJS (with Optional Cannon.js)
Purpose: Handles the 3D rendering for your wing-suit racing game.
Why ThreeJS?
It’s a lightweight, JavaScript-based library built on WebGL, allowing your game to run in any modern browser without plugins.
It’s widely adopted, with a large community, extensive documentation, and plenty of tutorials—ideal for keeping development straightforward.
For an MVP, it provides enough flexibility to create engaging visuals like flying wing-suits and racecourses without overwhelming complexity.
Physics with Cannon.js (Optional):
If your game needs basic physics (e.g., collision detection or simple flight mechanics), Cannon.js is a lightweight physics engine that integrates seamlessly with ThreeJS.
For an MVP, you might get by with ThreeJS’s built-in features alone, but Cannon.js is a simple add-on if needed.
Backend: Node.js with Socket.IO
Purpose: Manages real-time multiplayer interactions, such as synchronizing player positions and race events.
Why Node.js?
It’s event-driven and non-blocking, making it highly efficient for handling multiple player connections simultaneously—a must for a racing game.
Using JavaScript on both frontend and backend keeps the tech stack consistent, reducing the learning curve and simplifying development.
Why Socket.IO?
Built on WebSockets, it provides fast, bidirectional communication essential for real-time gameplay (e.g., seeing opponents fly alongside you).
It simplifies WebSocket management with features like event handling, room management, and fallbacks (e.g., long polling if WebSockets fail).
Compared to raw WebSockets, Socket.IO reduces complexity, which is key for an MVP focused on simplicity.
Deployment: Netlify and Heroku
Frontend Hosting (Netlify):
Since ThreeJS runs client-side, the frontend is just static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Netlify offers free, easy hosting for static sites with automatic scaling and a simple deployment process.
Alternatives like GitHub Pages work too, but Netlify’s features (e.g., custom domains) make it a robust choice.
Backend Hosting (Heroku):
Heroku supports Node.js and is beginner-friendly with a free tier, making it suitable for an MVP.
Note: The free tier has limitations (e.g., dynos sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity), but for an MVP, this is manageable. A small paid plan can address this if needed.
Alternatives like AWS or DigitalOcean offer more control but add complexity unnecessary for an MVP.
How It Fits Your Game
Multiplayer: Socket.IO ensures players’ movements and race progress sync in real time, delivering the competitive, interactive feel of a wing-suit race.
3D Graphics: ThreeJS renders the 3D environment—wing-suits, courses, and obstacles—while keeping it browser-accessible.
Simplicity: Sticking to JavaScript across the stack and using well-documented tools minimizes setup and development time.
Robustness: This setup supports the core MVP features (real-time racing, 3D visuals) and can scale later with added features like leaderboards or complex physics.
MVP Considerations
Game Logic: Keep critical logic (e.g., player positions, collisions) on the server to prevent cheating, with the client handling rendering and input.
Scope: Start with a single course, basic controls, and simple obstacles. Add features iteratively based on feedback.
Extras: Skip databases or authentication for now—use in-memory session data and anonymous players to keep it lean.
